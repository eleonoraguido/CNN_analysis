This program reads a .npz file, previously created by merging together the data of interest 
from two different particle species (generally photons and protons).

Two different tasks can be performed depending on the configuration file type:
-A CNN model is defined, trained and tested.
-A CNN model is loaded and tested.

In order to define, create and test a model, use the config.json file
Some arguments can be passed:
    -Path to the input file + input file name (the simulations)
    -Fraction of the data set that won't be used for training (test data set fraction)
    -Number of epochs
    -Batch size
    -Additional information to be printed in the output file name
    -Regularizer parameter L1 (penalty applied to absolute value of weights, 0-0.1)
    -Regularizer parameter L2 (penalty applied to square of weights, 0-0.1)

In order to load and test an existing model, use the config_load_model.json file
Some arguments can be passed:
    -Path to the input file + input file name (the simulations)
    -Fraction of the data set that won't be used for training (test data set fraction)
    -Name of the model without extension (two files should exist: .h5 and .json)


How to run the program:
source activate_env.sh
python3 main.py <config_file>
