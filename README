This program reads a .npz file, previously created by merging together the data of interest 
from two different particle species (generally photons and protons).

A CNN model is defined and trained.

Some arguments can be passed through the config file (example config.json):
    -Path to the input file + input file name
    -Fraction of the data set that won't be used for training (test data set fraction)
    -Number of epochs
    -Batch size
    -Additional information to be printed in the output file name
    -Regularizer parameter L1 (penalty applied to absolute value of weights, 0-0.1)
    -Regularizer parameter L2 (penalty applied to square of weights, 0-0.1)


How to run the program:
source activate_env.sh
python3 main.py config.json
